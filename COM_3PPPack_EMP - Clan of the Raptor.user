Unlike most other creatures, Eagle Clan saurians are able to serve as paladins while maintaining a chaotic good alignment, a blessing bestowed upon their clan by Horus himself. At the GM&apos;s option, certain non-Eagles that earn the favor of Horus may receive a similar boon.\n\n{b}The Eye of Ra:{/b} Horus is one of several deities that share the title, Eye of Ra. When the Eye of Ra title passes to Horus, the hawk god becomes an avatar of the personified Sun for as long as he retains the title.\n\nOther deities which periodically serve as the Eye of Ra include: Amon, god of the Goats Clans; Athor, goddess of the Ox Clans; Ishtar, goddess of the Cat Clans; Sobek, god of the Crocodile Clans; and Uraeus, god of the Snake Clans." compset="Deity" uniqueness="unique">

    <comment>When asked exactly how the “use your Wisdom score” effect works. the author had this to say, and therefore this is how I’ve best tried to implement this feature:

Ultimately, it&apos;s whatever interpretation the GM makes that matters.

Taken literally, you can use whichever score is highest at the time as your effective Charisma score for the purpose of oracle class abilities. Note that this effect alters your Charisma score, not the text of the oracle class itself. All of your oracle class features are still Charisma-based; you just get the option of setting your Charisma score equal to Wisdom score for the purpose of those Charisma-based features.

That last point is important because the Core Rules say ability damage &quot;does not actually reduce an ability, but it does apply a penalty to the skills and statistics that are based on that ability.&quot; Since your oracle class features are still technically Charisma-based, Charisma damage would penalize your oracle class features even if you are using your Wisdom score as your effective Charisma score. (Conversely, Wisdom damage would not penalize your oracle class features, because those features, as listed in the class description, are not Wisdom-based, despite your racial trait.)

On the other hand, ability drain and enhancement bonuses do change your ability scores. You apply ability drain and enhancement bonuses to your ability scores before deciding whether or not to use your (adjusted) Wisdom score in place of your (adjusted) Charisma score. So, if you invest in both Wisdom and Charisma, you end up getting a bit of a buffer against Charisma drain (but not against Charisma damage).</comment>

  <thing id="rEMPRaptCl" name="Saurian, Raptor Clan" description="Members of the Raptor Clans are one of several related races collectively known as saurians. Each of these humanoids has features resembling those of a particular reptile or bird. Although each saurian race has its own unique appearance and culture, all saurian races belong to a single family tree of ancient origin.\n\nAs their name suggests, members of the Raptor Clans are saurians whose physical features resemble those of various birds of prey—eagles, hawks, owls, and vultures.\n\n{b}Physical Description:{/b} In their natural forms, Raptor Clan saurians are humanoids with bird-like heads. Below the neck, Raptors have few avian features. At most, their fingers and toes resemble bird talons.\n\nDespite their avian nature, Raptors do not have wings when in their humanoid form. Instead, they are capable of assuming the forms of birds. While in bird form, a Raptor saurian retains its size and weight but none of its humanoid characteristics.\n\nMembers of the Vulture Clans are the Raptors most likely to be of average height and weight. Members of the Eagle and Hawk Clans tend to be taller and thinner than average, while members of the Owl Clan tend to be shorter and stockier.\n\n{b}Society:{/b} The saurians of the Raptor Clans are a race of fiercely independent hunters and warriors. They rarely gather to engage in large-scale warfare or conquest, but will ferociously defend their own territory. A typical Raptor Clan claims a stretch of wilderness that might take a few hours to cross on foot. The territory is patrolled by several allied individuals or families.\n\nAlthough independent and territorial, Raptors are not adverse to the idea of an overarching government that includes their lands within its borders. Most Raptors Clans are happy to support such an institution, provided their own personal rights and freedoms are protected by their nation. Conversely, an oppressive regime can expect fierce resistance from any Raptor Clan saurians it attempts to claim as subjects.\n\n{b}Relations:{/b} While not unfriendly, Raptor Clan saurians are warriors first and diplomats second. Raptors do not like being told to do, and will resist any effort made by outsiders to interfere in Raptor Clan internal affairs. They are also quick to confront individuals whom they perceive as intruders in their territory. These confrontations can erupt in open violence if the Raptors involved feel threatened or imposed upon.\n\nDespite the aggressive stance they take with neighbors and unwelcome guests, few Raptors go out of their way to be confrontational or rude. Most are happy to makes friends with non-Raptors who treat them with respect, especially non-Raptors who share their particular worldview.\n\n{b}Alignment and Religion:{/b} Raptor saurians exemplify the chaotic good alignment. Although the Raptor Clans are known for producing proud—and sometimes overenthusiastic—warriors, the targets of Raptor Clan aggression are slavers, tyrants, and other villains known for harming or oppressing the innocent. Raptors fight because they feel warfare is necessary to defend the rights of the innocent, not because they chafe at the idea of peaceful coexistence.\n\nThe warrior deities worshiped by Raptor Clan saurians tend to reflect these values. Most are living symbols of free but responsible existence. These beings promote codes of conduct that rely upon a small number of key principles, such as altruism, fair play, and respect for the rights of others. Followers of these deities are expected to challenge or disregard laws that fail to promote these core principles.\n\nIn addition to respecting deities that uphold these ideals, Raptors admire the founders of their clans. It is said that the souls of these revered ancestors are regularly reincarnated as modern-day Raptors. Few, if any, Raptors retain memories of their past lives, but most contend that the spirits of their clans&apos; founders live on through them in a very literal sense.\n\n{b}Adventurers:{/b} Raptor Clan saurians are aggressive and idealistic, a combination that motivates many to take up an adventuring lifestyle. Raptor Clan adventurers often start their career striking out against villains that threaten their native lands, either alone or with allies.\n\nRaptor Clan adventurers usually have good intentions, but can be openly critical of institutions that do not do enough to combat evil. Particularly chaotic Raptor Clan adventurers may even attempt to undermine complacent governments, or to provoke open warfare between various evil groups.\n\nSuch behavior tends to ruffle the feathers of lawful individuals, earning chaotic and non-good Raptors a reputation as potential demagogues and rebels. When opposing authorities they dislike, adventuring Raptor saurians of all alignments are more than happy to live up to this reputation." compset="Race">
